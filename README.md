## Introduction

Welcome to the Little Lemon Restaurant Project! This project is the capstone project for the Frontend Developer Certificate. The Little Lemon owners discovered that their customers were having trouble reserving tables through their website, leading to frustration and a less-than-optimal dining experience. To address this, we have developed a modern and user-friendly web application that allows customers to easily make table reservations, providing a seamless experience for both diners and the restaurant staff.
